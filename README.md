eidogo
======

Web-based Go app and embeddable SGF viewer. This repository ports it to be a YUI 
module which substantially simplifies the code.   Additionaly, upgraded the renderer to be canvas.
At some point in the future, re-adding an HTML renderer (for failback)  may be wise -- it should not be difficult.
